SunRay Server on Ubuntu/Linux installation package
==================================================

This package is trying to provide all necessary stuff that is required
to install the SunRay Software (SRS) on an Ubuntu/Linux server. In fact,
it is the attempt to provide a kind of a 'package' that has everything
embedded to get the SRS installed on Ubuntu/Linux with just a single
shell script execution.

Please note, that this installation package is NOT officially supported
by Oracle, nor does it come with ANY implied or explicit warranty that
it works as it should or that it does not destroy your system. Thus,
you are using it on your own will and responsibilities.

Furthermore, it does NOT come with the original SRS installation file.
Thus, you need to manually download/purchase it from one of the known
Oracle pages (e.g., https://edelivery.oracle.com). In addition, to
actually run the SRS from Oracle you need to have the proper licenses
to be allowed to use it with your SunRay clients. So please contact
your local Oracle dealer/sales-representative and ask for the proper
licenses before you use the SRS.

Installation
============

To install SRS you need to follow this procedure:

(1) Unarchive this installation package to a temporary directory

    tar xjf srs-ubuntu-install-1.0.tar.bz2

(2) Change your current directory to "srs-ubuntu-install"

    cd srs-ubuntu-install

(3) Download the SRS installation zip from https://edelivery.oracle.com
    to the srs-ubuntu-install directory.

(4) Make sure you have the gdm-2.20.10 packages installed. Eventually
    install it via:

    dpkg -i deb/gdm-2.20_2.20.10-0ubuntu3_amd64.deb

(5) Make sure you have an OSS enabled kernel installed. Eventually
    install it via:
 
    dpkg -i deb/linux-headers-2.6.38.7-srss_2.6.38.7-srss-10.00.Custom_amd64.deb
    dpkg -i deb/linux-image-2.6.38.7-srss_2.6.38.7-srss-10.00.Custom_amd64.deb

(6) Make sure to reboot your system in case you install the new kernel
    from (5) and verify that the kernel is running after the reboot.
    After reboot, change to the temporary directory again where the
    srs-ubuntu-install packages was extracted to.

(7) Run the "srs-ubuntu-install.sh" script and answer all questions
    accordingly.

    ./srs-ubuntu-install.sh

(8) After the installation is finished make sure to reboot your server
    for proper operation of the SRS
