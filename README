SunRay Server on Debian/Linux installation package
==================================================

This package is trying to provide all necessary stuff that is required
to install the SunRay Software (SRS) on an Debian/Linux server. In fact,
it is the attempt to provide a kind of a 'package' that has everything
embedded to get the SRS installed on Debian/Linux with just a single
shell script execution.

It assumes clean install and will pull in all necessary packages WITHOUT
asking for explicit confirmation. Use at your own risk; and do first
install on a test installation before pushing it into production(!)

Please note, that this installation package is NOT officially supported
by Oracle, nor does it come with ANY implied or explicit warranty that
it works as it should or that it does not destroy your system. Thus,
you are using it on your own will and responsibilities.

Furthermore, it does NOT come with the original SRS installation file.
Thus, you need to manually download/purchase it from one of the known
Oracle pages (e.g., https://edelivery.oracle.com). In addition, to
actually run the SRS from Oracle you need to have the proper licenses
to be allowed to use it with your SunRay clients. So please contact
your local Oracle dealer/sales-representative and ask for the proper
licenses before you use the SRS.

Installation
============

To install SRS you need to follow this procedure:

(1) Checkout this package somewhere

(2) Change your current directory to it

(3) Download the SRS installation zip from https://edelivery.oracle.com
    to the checked out directory (or one level above).

    It was tested with V26743-01.zip but might work with other versions.

(4) Run the "srs-deb-squeeze-install.sh" script and answer all questions
    accordingly.

    ./srs-deb-squeeze-install.sh

(5) You might be asked to fix DHCPd config and re-run the script. Just
    use your brain and/or email me (Michal Jirku) if you get into
    trouble.

    Most likely you'll have to add "subnet" definition(s) to your
    /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf like this:

    subnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
      not authoritative;
    }

(6) After the installation is finished make sure to follow the
    instructions displayed at the end
